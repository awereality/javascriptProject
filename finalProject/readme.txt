--- Pokemon Drag N' Drop ---
Please note that this game will take some time to load...

This game allows players to grab and drop their favorite pokemon anywhere on the screen!

My first game, the Pokemon drag and drop is very user friendly. 

All characters will be presented in a row along the top of the screen.

Refresh the page to restart

For a future release, I want to add a side menu that contains the Pokemon.

All content and images are belonging to the repsective Pokemon copyright.

--- Tic-Tac-Toe ---
My second game is Tic-Tac-Toe, it is a pattern game that can be played with a friend. 

Left click on a tile to place an O or X, then align your placements to form a pattern of 3.

After someone has reached a pattern of 3, the game grid will dissapear.

Use the reset button to play again.

In a future update, I would expand the grid to allow more patterns.

Current bugs, if your winning pattern happens to be on the last tile of the grid, it will return a tie.

All content on this page can be reused/repurposed without concern.

--- Fly Trap --- 

The third game is called Fly Trap.

To play, use your cursor to navigate the fly through the path of venus traps!

The traps are sensitive, keep as much distance from the top and the bottom traps.

I noted an issue before, the obstacles size and images need to be revamped. 

The mouse cursor will also be hidden while playing the game.

For the future update, I want varying obstacles and to increase the speed with time.
