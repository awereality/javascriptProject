The audience this is targeting are those individuals who appreciate minimilistic pages. It has at most a handful of colors on the page at all times, keeping it kosher.

I personally really liked what I made, so much that I used a couple of the shapes on the page to open the overlay navigation menu.

I selected or in other words ended up with this design scheme because I just reinstalled paint.net for this project. I used paint for a lot of the designs you see, I modified the logos plently to accopmany my white and black theme. I created the shape patterns within paint aswell.

I believe that the menu design has a good chance to make visitors more engaged, due to the outline shape design accompanied with the pulsing elements on the page aswell.

The only notable coding issues that I encountered were changing my absolute values to relative.
